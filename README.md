# Trapezoidal-numerical-integration-Python
In mathematics, the trapezoidal rule, also known as the trapezoid rule or trapezium rule is a technique for approximating the definite integral in numerical analysis. The trapezoidal rule is an integration rule used to calculate the area under a curve by dividing the curve into small trapezoids.
<br /> This program implements Trapezoidal Numerical Integration Method in python programming language.
<br /> f = The function that you can use lambda or numpy library. 
<br /> The default value of N is 50.
<br /> At the end of the codes there are 2 examples of using the simps function.
<br /> I hope you find it useful. Email me if you have any questions about this code.
