# Trapezoidal-numerical-integration-Python
In mathematics, the trapezoidal rule, also known as the trapezoid rule or trapezium rule is a technique for approximating the definite integral in numerical analysis. The trapezoidal rule is an integration rule used to calculate the area under a curve by dividing the curve into small trapezoids.
This program implements Trapezoidal Numerical Integration Method in python programming language. I hope you find it useful. Email me if you have any questions about this code.
